# Dog Breed Classifier - Project 5 of Udacity's AI Nanodegree

This project was to build an end to end algorithm that takes and image of a human or dog face, determines which it is, then gives a prediction for the most likely dog breed.

The model for the dog breed classification was able to obtain an accuracy rate of 93.6% on 133 breeds, training on only 6680 images.
