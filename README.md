This project was to build an end to end algorithm that takes and image of a human or dog face, determines which it is, then gives a prediction for the most likely dog breed. The model for the dog breed classification was able to obtain an accuracy rate of 93.6% on 133 breeds.

An overview of the project is described in <a href=https://macbrennan90.github.io/dog-breed-classifier.html>this blog post</a>.
